                <p>The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles. The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family to the bass trumpet, pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C trumpet.
                  Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting .They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.
                  A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter. 
                  The English word trumpet was first used in the late 14th century.[5] The word came from Old French trompette, which is a diminutive of trompe.[5] The word trump, meaning trumpet, was first used in English in 1300. The word comes from Old French trompe 'long, tube-like musical wind instrument'

                <p>The piano is a keyboard instrument that produces sound when pressed on the keys. Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys: 52 white keys for the notes of the C major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A and B) and 36 shorter  black keys raised above the white keys and set further back,for sharps and flats. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches (or "notes"), spanning a range of a bit over seven octaves. The black keys are for the "accidentals" (F♯/G♭, G♯/A♭, A♯/B♭, C♯/D♭, and D♯/E♭), which are needed to play in all twelve keys.
                The English word piano is a shortened form of the Italian pianoforte,[3] derived from clavicembalo col piano e forte ("key harpsichord with soft and loud").The invention of the piano is credited to Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655-1731) of Padua, Italy, who was employed by Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany, as the Keeper of the Instruments.</p>

                <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings.It's usually held flat against player's body  and played by strumming or plucking the strings with dominant hand,while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand.
                 The English word guitar, the German Gitarre, and the French guitare were all adopted from the Spanish guitarra, which comes from the Andalusian Arabic قيثارة (qīthārah)[6] and the Latin cithara, which in turn came from the Ancient Greek κιθάρα. This Greek word may also come from the Persian word Sihtar.[7] Kithara appears in the Bible four times (1 Cor. 14:7, Rev. 5:8, 14:2 and 15:2), and is usually translated into English as harp.</p>

                <p>The tuba is the lowest-pitched musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass instruments, the sound is produced by lip vibration - a buzz  into a mouthpiece. It first appeared in the mid-19th century, making it one of the newer instruments in the modern orchestra and concert band.
                  A person who plays the tuba is called a tubaist, a tubist,[4] or simply a tuba player. In a British brass band or military band, they are known as bass players.
                Prussian Patent No. 19 was granted to Wilhelm Friedrich Wieprecht and Johann Gottfried Moritz (1777-1840)[5] on September 12, 1835 for a "bass tuba" in F1. The original Wieprecht and Moritz instrument used five valves of the Berlinerpumpen type that were the forerunners of the modern piston valve. The first tenor tuba was invented in 1838 by Carl Wilhelm Moritz (1810-1855), son of Johann Gottfried Moritz.</p>

                <p>The cello, or violoncello, Italian pronunciation: [vjolonˈtʃɛllo]),[1] is a bowed (sometimes plucked and occasionally hit) string instrument of the violin family. Its four strings are usually tuned in perfect fifths: from low to high, C2, G2, D3 and A3. The viola's four strings are each an octave higher. Music for the cello is generally written in the bass clef, with tenor clef, and treble clef used for higher-range passages.
                The name cello is derived from the ending of the Italian violoncello,[2] which means "little violone". Violone ("big viola") was a large-sized member of viol (viola da gamba) family or the violin (viola da braccio) family. In modern symphony orchestras, it is the second largest stringed instrument (the double bass is the largest).</p>

                <p>The first step to being successful in Vocal Techniques is understanding that the vocal instrument is entire body with no external instrument.This may be quite an adjustment for the instrumenta-list since working with a voice is especially personal.Students might initially feel helpless because<br> they cannot directly control the voice.
                The more knowledge and skills future teachers have about the vocal instrument, the more capable they will be in teaching themselves and others. The best recommendation is to study voice privately. Although there are many “self-teaching” resources available, reading text and watching videos cannot replace another set of human ears. It is easy to misinterpret information and there is a lot of incorrect information on the web.</p>
